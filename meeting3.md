# **Third Meeting: Monday, November 23⋅3:00 – 4:00pm UTC**

After a MVP for the github registry was written, this meeting covers some of the first learnings and next steps with an in-depth discussion around the technicalities of using the stored data to crawl the connect blockchains.
In the second half [CAIP issue 27](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/issues/27) was discussed, to address ammending asset IDs and types with information of whether they have been moved to different chains.
The last topic of discussion were different infrastructure issues such as incentivizing node operators.
