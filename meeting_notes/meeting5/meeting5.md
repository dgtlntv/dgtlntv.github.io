# 5. Meeting, Dec 21 2020

Having the registry on a centralized service like github is suboptimal. Using the main cosmos hub to store information about the different chains instead was discussed during this meeting. The cosmos hub as the center of the cosmos universe would make sense as registry but adding new features is a time intensive and slow process.
Afterwards followed an update to the github registry and the possibility of adding modules (most features are contained in their own modules, so having a registry of the modules available would allow people to inspect the features of any given blockchain) to the registry as well.
